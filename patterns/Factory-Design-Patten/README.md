# Factory Design Pattern

The Factory method is one of the most widely used design patterns. It functions as an interface for making objects that are modifiable after they are created. The difficulty creating objects without depending on the traditional constructor technique is addressed by this pattern. Rather, it creates the newly desired object based on the configuration or description that it receives (Cocca, 2022).


In JavaScript, calling a constructor function with the new operator is a common way to create an object. Nevertheless, there are situations in which the client doesn't know or shouldn't be concerned with which of multiple possible objects to create. The value of the Factory Method resides in its ability to enable the client to assign object creation while retaining control over the kind of object that is instantiated (Poorte, 2023).


Here's an example demonstrating the Factory Method pattern in JavaScript:
