# Facade Design Pattern
The facade design pattern is a structural design pattern that enables users to construct an easy-to-use interface by concealing the complex implementation details of the system (Poorte, 2023). The goal of this pattern is to hide the implementation details from users and provide a uniform, simplified interface for a collection of interfaces, making them easier to use (GeeksforGeeks, 2023).

## Uses of Facade Design Pattern
1. Facade offers a higher-level interface, which makes interacting with complex subsystems easier.
2. Facade serves as an API between the presentation layer and service layer in multi-layer web applications, concealing the complex nature of business objects and interactions.
3. Facade can be used to modify complicated or confusing legacy code by hiding its complexities behind a simpler interface, making it simpler for clients to work with.
4. Facade is frequently used with other design patterns, such as Singleton or Factory, to improve usability and provide a consistent interface for client interaction.
